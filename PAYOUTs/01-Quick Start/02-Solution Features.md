# Solution Features

The API solution of the Monnet Payout platform was developed with REST technology, which is the market standard and also independent from the technology used by other parties. This way, it is possible to integrate it through the great majority of programming languages, such as: ASP, ASP. Net, Java, PHP, Ruby, Python, etc.

Amongst other features, the attributes that stand out the most in the Monnet Payout platform are:

**No proprietary apps:** it is not necessary to install any applications in the virtual shop environment, under no circumstances.

**Simplicity:** the protocol used is purely HTTPS.

**Ease of testing:** the Monnet platform offers a publicly accessible Testing environment (Certification Environment), which allows the developer to create a test account making it easier and faster to start integration.

**Credentials:** handling of the customer’s credentials (Merchant ID and API Key Monnet) traffics in the header of the HTTP request of the message.

**Safety:** the information exchange always takes place between your Server and Monnet's Server, that is, without the buyer’s browser in between.

**Multiplatform:** the integration is performed through the REST Web Service.
