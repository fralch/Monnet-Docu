# Solution Features

The API solution of the Monnet Platform was developed to receive HTTP POST requests. This way, it is possible to integrate it through the great majority of programming languages, such as ASP, ASP. Net, Java, PHP, Ruby, Python, etc.

Amongst other features, the attributes that stand out the most in the Monnet platform are:

* **No proprietary apps:** it is not necessary to install any applications in the virtual shop environment, under no circumstances.
* **Simplicity:** the protocol used is purely HTTPS.
* **Ease of testing:** the Monnet platform offers a publicly accessible Testing environment (Certification Environment), which allows the developer to create a test account making it easier and faster to start integration.
* **Credentials:** handling of the customer’s credentials (payinMerchantID and KeyMonnet) traffics in the header of the HTTP request of the message.
* **Safety:** the information exchange always takes place between your Server and Monnet's Server, that is, without the buyer’s browser in between.
* **Transaction Volume:** A maximum 10 Transactions per second is recomended.
