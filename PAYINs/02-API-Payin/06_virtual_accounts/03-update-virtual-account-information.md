# Update Virtual Account Information

This method allows the merchant to update non-sensitive information of an existing virtual bank account within Monnet. Changes can include metadata, labels, or other account attributes that do not affect the core banking identifiers or transactional capabilities.

Merchants can modify only the accounts they have created, and updates are reflected immediately in Monnet, ensuring that subsequent operations or queries return the latest account information. Sensitive fields such as the account number, personal information or country cannot be changed through this method.
