# Update Virtual Account Status

This method allows the merchant to update the operational status of an existing virtual bank account within Monnet. Status changes can include activating, deactivating, or blocking the account, controlling whether it can receive new deposits or be used in transactions.

Merchants can modify only the accounts they have created, and status updates are applied immediately in Monnet, ensuring that subsequent operations or queries reflect the current account state. Core account information, user details, or banking identifiers cannot be modified through this method.

## 📝 Update Request

### 🔐 Header

All requests to the this endpoint must include a custom **Authorization** header to ensure secure communication and proper merchant validation.

| Header | Required | Value Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| X-Api-Key | ✅ Yes | Public merchant identifier |
| X-Timestamp | ✅ Yes | Unix timestamp of the request. Validated against a time window ≤ 2 minutes. |
| X-Signature | ✅ Yes | HMAC_SHA512(secret-key, timestamp + api-key) |

The **signature** value must be a **SHA-512 hash** generated by concatenating the fields as decribed.

> The ***secret-key*** is a credential provided by Monnet that must be used to build the final string before generating the hash.

### 📦 Request Data

Specifies the structure and required parameters that must be included in the request body to update the operational status of an existing virtual account, ensuring the change is correctly applied and immediately reflected in Monnet.

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| status | **String (Optional)** <br> Status to change the account. Enum: ACTIVE, INACTIVE, DELETED |
| reason | **String (Optional)** <br> Short reason of change. |

> **📘 Important to Know**
>
> The `INACTIVE` status is not available for ARG. If this status is sent in the request, the API will return an error. At this time, virtual accounts in Argentina can only be set to `ACTIVE` or `DELETED`; inactive an account is not supported for this country.

> **❗️ Be careful**
>
> Setting the account status to `DELETED` will permanently remove the user and disable the virtual account. The account will no longer be able to receive transfers, and this action is irreversible.

#### Request body example

The merchant must send a JSON payload with the following structure:

```json
{
  "status": "INACTIVE",
  "reason": "Requested by merchant"
}
```
